# ReverseString

**Application description:**

The purpose of this application is to get strings from the input file, reverse each string row by row, and save the resulting strings to the output file in the same way as they were placed in the input file.

When the application starts, it reads the input file and writes each string row by row to the previously created string list. One item in the list is one read string. The list of strings is then passed to a method that reverses each string in the list, taking its letters from the end, and adds a new string to the newly created list that will hold the reversed strings. Finally, the list of reversed strings is written to the output file. Each string is written row by row using a line break.
